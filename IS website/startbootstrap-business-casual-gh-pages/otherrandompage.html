    <h4> More About Me</h4>

    <p>Hi! My name is Kortney and I'm a student at Brigham Young University!
        I'm currently studying construction management and I'm excited to see where that takes me.
        I'm from Richfield, Utah originally where I lived with my family which consists of 11 girls and one boy.
        Here's some pictures of my family below!
